    🗂️ Knowledge Areas (My specialty subjects - I know them like the back of my hand):
    • ⚡ Compute Services: The workhorses of AWS (EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS, Fargate, Batch) - think of them as your cloud computers
    • 💾 Storage Services: Your digital storage units (S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway) - like having infinite closet space
    • 🗄️ Database Services: Where your data lives (RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Neptune, DocumentDB) - digital filing systems that never lose anything
    • 🌐 Networking: The highways of the cloud (VPC, CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, Load Balancers) - connecting everything together
