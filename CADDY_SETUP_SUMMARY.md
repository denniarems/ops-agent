# Caddy Reverse Proxy Setup - Complete

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The Caddy reverse proxy has been successfully added to the ZapGap application with the following features:

### 🔧 Configuration Files Created

1. **`Caddyfile`** - Development configuration (HTTP only)
2. **`Caddyfile.production`** - Production configuration (HTTPS with Let's Encrypt)
3. **`Caddyfile.development`** - Backup of development configuration
4. **`caddy-config.sh`** - Management script for switching configurations
5. **`CADDY_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### 🐳 Docker Compose Updates

- **Added Caddy service** with proper health checks and dependencies
- **Updated server service** to be internal-only (no external port exposure)
- **Added Caddy volumes** for persistent certificate storage
- **Fixed health checks** by installing curl in server container
- **Proper networking** between all services

### 🔒 Security Features

- **Security headers** applied (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **CORS configuration** for development
- **SSL/TLS termination** ready for production
- **Error handling** with custom error pages
- **Rate limiting** configuration available

### 🌐 Network Architecture

```
Internet → Caddy (Port 80/443) → Server (Port 3000) → Agent (Port 4111)
```

- **Caddy**: Exposed on ports 80 and 443
- **Server**: Internal only, accessible via Caddy
- **Agent**: Internal only, accessible by server

### 📊 Health Checks

All services have proper health checks:
- **Caddy**: `http://localhost:80/health`
- **Server**: `http://localhost:3000/health` (internal)
- **Agent**: `http://localhost:4111/health` (internal)

### 🚀 Current Status

```bash
$ docker compose ps
NAME            STATUS                    PORTS
zapgap-agent    Up (healthy)             4111/tcp
zapgap-caddy    Up (healthy)             0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp
zapgap-server   Up (healthy)             3000/tcp
```

### ✅ Verified Working

- ✅ Caddy reverse proxy routing
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Security headers applied
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Service dependencies
- ✅ Container health monitoring

## 🎯 Usage

### Development
```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Access application
curl http://localhost/

# Check health
curl http://localhost/health
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Switch to production configuration
./caddy-config.sh prod your-domain.com

# Update email in Caddyfile for Let's Encrypt
# Deploy
docker compose up -d
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Switch to development
./caddy-config.sh dev

# Switch to production
./caddy-config.sh prod example.com

# Check status
./caddy-config.sh status

# Validate configuration
./caddy-config.sh validate
```
